### What I learned

Creating this profile card with HTML and CSS was a rewarding experience that improved my understanding of web design basics. I learned how to organize content well using semantic HTML elements like <header>, <section>, and <footer>. This not only made the site more accessible but also made the code easier to manage. Styling the card with CSS, including rounded corners, a dark theme, and hover effects on social links, showed me the importance of using properties like border-radius, linear-gradient, and transition to make it look better and more interactive. Adjusting the layout to center the card and ensure it works on different screen sizes also gave me hands-on experience with margins, padding and flexbox.

This project also helped me improve my skills in color theory and typography by matching the design to the provided image, using a dark background with bright text colors like lime green for emphasis. I learned how to use pseudo-classes like :hover to create engaging user experiences and how to optimize image display with border-radius: 50% for circular avatars. Solving problems, such as aligning elements correctly and keeping consistent spacing, improved my problem-solving skills and attention to detail. Overall, this exercise increased my confidence in building custom, attractive components from scratch using HTML and CSS.

### Continued development

To continue my development after creating the profile card, I am focusing on improving my skills in several key areas. I am diving deeper into responsive design by mastering media queries and flexible layouts using tools like flexbox and grid to ensure my projects adapt smoothly across devices, from mobiles to tablets. I am exploring advanced CSS techniques, including animations with @keyframes and transform, advanced selectors, and CSS variables, to create more dynamic and reusable styles.
